# Data Analytics Project: Comprehensive Analysis of Forest Cover Types

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the cover type of forest areas based on various geographical and environmental features. The dataset used in this project can be accessed from the following URL: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Covertype Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype)

## Prerequisites

To execute the code, make sure you have the following software and libraries installed on your local machine:

1. Python 3
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Required Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

If any of these components are missing, please install them before proceeding to the execution steps.

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3:** Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and download the latest version of Python 3 based on your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup.

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:** Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

pip install jupyter

3. **Install Required Libraries:** Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


## Data File

1. **Download the dataset file:** Click [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype) to download the dataset file called `covtype.data`.

2. **Save the downloaded file:** Place the downloaded `covtype.data` file in the project directory.

## Execution

To execute the code, follow the steps below:

1. **Download the project files:** Clone or download this GitHub repository, including the Jupyter Notebook file (`Covertype_Prediction.ipynb`)

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Open a command prompt or terminal and run the command `jupyter notebook`. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

3. **Access the project directory:** Navigate to the project directory within Jupyter Notebook and open the `Covertype_Prediction.ipynb` file.

4. **Execute the code:** Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code step by step.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook itself. You can explore the final predictions and evaluation metrics directly in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to predict the cover type of forest areas using machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree. The provided Jupyter Notebook contains all the necessary code and instructions for execution.
